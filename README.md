# Premise / Concepts:

## This project is largely using basic JavaScript Functions, Methods, and Objects. Specifically in my code, Arrays. An overall lesson learned, and the most difficult hurdle to surmount was simplification of structure. 
<br>

- Therefore the functionality of Inventory uses arrays and array methods to take and drop items, from room and player Arrays. It also uses Class constuctors to create instances of Items and Rooms. These are then pushed en masse to the proper places.

    - Items are pushed to rooms,
    - Exits are created by assigning values to directional keys which exist on rooms (i.e. `foyer.north = livingRoom`, and so on). <br>
<br>

- It is to be hoped that the simplified structure is better and displays more encapsulation and ease of reading.
<br>

## This was a fun concept, although difficult project to get on its feet initially. I very much enjoyed the conceptualizing and staged building aspects of the game, and look forward to adding more function to it such as puzzles, traps, locks, magic, etc. I will definitely work on this more, moving forward with hopes of creating a fully functional game. 
<br>

## With the popularity of "`retro-style`" nostalgia, maybe there will even be a market for these OG style games, if designers can find new ways to update them for today's audience, whilst retaining their essential "Zorkiness", transforming them with `AI` and `VR`.
